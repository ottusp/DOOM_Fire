The credit for this code is not mine, neither is the idea. Check the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxm8cadCqbs&t=562s), as well as a neat write-up from Fabien Sanglard [here](http://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/).

You can also check the [doom.html](doom.html) file running [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ottusp/DOOM_Fire/blob/master/doom.html).
